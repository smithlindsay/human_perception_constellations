# human_perception_constellations
GitHub repo of code, spreadsheets, and data for the Human Perception of the Starry Sky paper.

The main script is constellation_script.m, which can be used to run all analyses from the paper.

Note: We did not include 29 of the 9110 stars cataloged with HR numbers. The stars excluded had HR numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 92, 95, 182, 192, 824, 1057, 1386, 1390, 1397, 1398, 1654, 1841, 2472, 2496, 2518, 3515, 3671, 6119, 6309, 6515, 7189, 7492, 7539, and 8296. HR number 1654 was also removed from the list of line-drawing stars.
